	<p style="margin-left: 150px"> Though it is easy to imagine how health is tied to income for the very poor or the very rich, the relationship 
		between income and health is a gradient: they are connected step-wise at every level of the economic ladder. Middle-class Americans are 
		healthier than those living in or near poverty, but they are less healthy than the upper class. Even wealthy Americans are less healthy 
		than those Americans with higher incomes.</p>
		
	<p style="margin-left: 150px"> From information based on 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates, one meaningful relationship is  
		the observation between the relatively high poverty rate of 17.2% in Texas and correspondingly high percentage of the population (24.9%) 
		without healthcare coverage.  Inversely, Massachusetts reports a marginally low percentage of those categorized 
		as living in poverty at 11.6% with an equally low percentage of those lacking healthcare coverage (4.6%.) </p>

	<p style="margin-left: 150px"> 
		While not included in the analysis of this study, further findings indicate that income is a driving force behind the striking health disparities 
		that many minorities experience. In fact, although blacks and Hispanics have higher rates of disease than non-Hispanic whites, these differences 
		are “dwarfed by the disparities identified between high- and low-income populations within each racial/ ethnic group.”4 That is, higher-income blacks, 
		Hispanics, and Native Americans have better health than members of their groups with less income, and this income gradient appears to be more strongly 
		tied to health than their race or ethnicity.</p>
